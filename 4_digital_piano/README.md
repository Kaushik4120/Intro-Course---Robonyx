# Project 4: Digital Piano

This project combines what I learnt from the Robonyx starter course with an integrated LCD display system to create a simple digital piano using Arduino.

## Equipment used:

- Arduino Mega 2560
- Buttons (5x)
- Potentiometer (2.2kΩ - 10kΩ)
- Passive buzzer
- LCD 1602 module
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- USB cable

## Brief project description:

- Practical use: Combines buttons, potentiometer, buzzer and LCD display to create a simple digital piano system.

- Potentiometer: Adjusts the LCD contrast level to improve visibility.

- LCD: Displays the note name and frequency corresponding to the button being pressed.

- Buttons: Five buttons are used, each representing a different note from the C Major scale (4th octave).

- Passive buzzer: Produces the sound output using the frequency corresponding to the pressed button.

## Learning outcomes:

- Learnt how to use arrays and loops to make code cleaner, more efficient and easier to expand.

- Learnt how to use a new hardware component (LCD 1602 module) from scratch and integrate it into an existing project.

- Learnt how to use library functions to simplify hardware communication (LiquidCrystal library).

- Improved my understanding of circuit organisation and ways to reduce congestion when using multiple components.

- Improved my debugging approach by identifying and solving both software and hardware issues.

## My improvements / experimentations:

- Used arrays combined with loops instead of repeated conditional statements, making it easier to add new notes onto the piano.

- Integrated an LCD display to provide real-time visual feedback instead of only using the Serial Monitor.

- Experimented with improving the physical circuit layout by using longer jumper wires and repositioning components for easier interaction.

- Explored future improvements such as button debouncing and more advanced sound processing methods to support multiple notes/chords.

- Developed a better understanding of the difference between `lcd.clear()` and `lcd.setCursor()` functions from the LiquidCrystal library.

## Troubleshooting log:

1. Issue: Due to the increased complexity of the project, I made repeated syntax and pin connection errors, such as missing semicolons, incorrect pin numbers and small mistakes in breadboard connections.

Fix: I created a checklist framework that I followed before uploading completed project code. This included checking pin assignments, wiring connections and code syntax, which reduced repeated mistakes.

2. Issue: The breadboard became too congested, making it difficult to press the buttons properly.

Fix: I used longer jumper wires for the button inputs and moved the buttons towards the edge of the breadboard, creating more space and making the circuit easier to interact with.

3. Issue: Some buttons were not fitting tightly into the breadboard and would move when pressed.

Fix: I checked the button orientation and positioning on the breadboard to ensure a more secure connection.

## Future improvements:

- Implement button debouncing for more reliable button detection.

- Add support for playing multiple notes simultaneously (chords).

- Improve sound generation to create a more realistic piano experience.

- Add LED indicators for visual feedback when notes are played.
